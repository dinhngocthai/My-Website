                I wondered what was game, who made it or even just a simple question, that, could I make a game like that. 
                I reliazed that the logic of program's algorithms are really attractive Now I am third-years student and study at Nong Lam University, learn about Java, Data structure, Graphics,... I have completed my fisrt simple web project, and the second when I finish this semester. 
                If nothing changed, I really want to build a studio, just for my dream in the future, and for people who want to join with me.
